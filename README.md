# PhotoSharingApp
A social media photo app for sharing photos and looking up the location of where the photo was taken.
The app requires you to log in. After you've logged in, you can, with the floating action button, either take a photo with the device's camera, or select a photo from the gallery. The photo will then show up among a list of all the photos taken by everyone who used this app. The photos will be diplayed along with the username of the uploader. On another page there will be a map where there will be a marker for every location where a photo was taken. Each marker will have the username of the uploader and the photo itself.
